Once the filter group is created, three layers will be created automatically,
you can easily adjust them according to your needs. Please make sure
that the level starts from 1 and has no gaps.

Now you can start directly with the maintenance of the manufacturers. With larger amounts of data
the import should be done by a professional developer.

After creating a manufacturer, click on the three dots (..) and on Edit
to get to the next level. There you can maintain as many layers as you like.

To apply the filter, you now need an adjustment in the category listing.
Go to the "Sidebar" blocks and drag the "Accessory Filter" element into the template.

After you have saved the CMS page, make sure that this page has also been assigned to the
category where the accessories products are located.
